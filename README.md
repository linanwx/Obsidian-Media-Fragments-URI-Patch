# Obsidian Media Fragments URI Patch

This plugin enables the media (like video or audio) in Obsidian to support the Media Fragments URI attribute, which allows the media to play the specified segment, or the timestamp.

The function of this plugin is similar to media extended, but I found some problems when I used that plugin, so I developed this plugin.

This plugin only focuses on the implement of Media Fragments URI, reducing the scope of influence as much as possible, so I hope there might be less problem.

It supports live preview.

Use the following methods to make a Media Fragments.

```
![[audio.mp3#t=1,2]]
```

## Manually installing the plugin

- Copy over `main.js`, `manifest.json` from release to your vault `VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/Obsidian-Media-Fragments-URI-Patch/`.

## Example demonstrates

- This video shows how it works on video and audio.
